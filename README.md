# Project #2: Traffic Sign Classifier

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. It's a convolutional neural network used to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/).
## Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

  - Machine learning regression and classification
  - Neural networks, including deep neural networks and convolution neural networks
  - Data pre-processing, including normalization, color channels, and image manipulation using OpenCV and Matplotlib
  - Constructing and training neural networks using TensorFlow
  - Logisitic classifiers, stochastic gradient descent, and back-propagation
  - Soft-max probabilities, cross-entropy, and L2 regularization
  - Training neural networks using a GPU on Amazon Web Services
